# GitHub Action â€” Report natspec smells

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) allows you to leverage GitHub Actions to report [natspec smells](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/natspec-smells) findings.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#common-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith)

- `natspec-smells-file`: The natspec-smells files to scan. For example, `natspec-smells-report.txt`
- `github-token`: Set the `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` token to have the action comment the natspec smells findings summary in the pull request. This token is provided by Actions, you do not need to create your own token. Optional. Default: ``
- `working-directory`: The working directory containing the source files referenced in the LCOV files. Optional. Default: `./`
- `update-comment`: Set to `true` to update the previous natspec smells comment if such exists. When set to `false`, a new comment is always created. Optional. Default: `false`

### Outputs
- `total-smells`: The total smells founds by natspec-smells

      uses: Yashiru/natspec-smells-ci@v1
      with:
        natspec-smells-file: natspec-smells-report.txt
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        working-directory: ./
